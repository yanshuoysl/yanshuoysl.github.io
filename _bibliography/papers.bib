  abstract={Efficient task allocation is a challenge for multi-robot search. 
    The multi-robot search problem is reformulated as submodular maximization subject to intersection system constraints. 
    The objective function is submodular and consists of a coverage function to cover environments and a balancing function to efficiently dispatch robots. 
    The intersection system is composed of routing and clustering constraints. 
    The experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-robot search.},
