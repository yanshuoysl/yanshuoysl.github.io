  abstract={Efficient task allocation is a challenge for multi-robot search. 
    The multi-robot search problem is reformulated as submodular maximization subject to intersection system constraints. 
    The objective function is submodular and consists of a coverage function to cover environments and a balancing function to efficiently dispatch robots. 
    The intersection system is composed of routing and clustering constraints. 
    The experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-robot search.},

@article{li2024computation,
  abstract={Searching for targets in 3D environments can be formulated as submodular maximization problems with routing constraints. 
    However, it involves solving two NP-hard problems: the maximal coverage problem and the traveling salesman problem. 
    Since the time constraint is critical for search problems, this research proposes a Computation-Aware Search for Multiple Objects (CASMO) algorithm to further consider the computational time in the cost constraints. 
    Due to the submodularity, the greedy algorithm achieves $\frac{1}{2}\left( {1 - \frac{1}{e}} \right)\overline {OPT} $, where $\overline {OPT} $ is the approximate optimum. 
    The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multi-object search.},

  abstract={The automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for its association with the risk of embolic stroke. 
    Most of the existing AF detection methods usually convert 1D time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) signal into 2D spectrogram to train a complex AF detection system, which results in heavy training computation and high implementation cost. 
    This paper proposes an AF detection method based on an end-to-end 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to raise the detection accuracy and reduce network complexity. 
    By investigating the impact of major components of a convolutional block on detection accuracy and using grid search to obtain optimal hyperparameters of the CNN, we develop a simple, yet effective 1D CNN. 
    Since the dataset provided by PhysioNet Challenge 2017 contains ECG recordings with different lengths, we also propose a length normalization algorithm to generate equal-length records to meet the requirement of CNN. 
    Experimental results and analysis indicate that our method of 1D CNN achieves an average F1 score of 78.2%, which has better detection accuracy with lower network complexity, as compared with the existing deep learning-based methods.},
