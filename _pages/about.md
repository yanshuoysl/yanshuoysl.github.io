I am a research assistant at National Central University in Taiwan.

My research focuses on multi-robot systems, decision making, and reinforcement learning. Currently, I work on multi-robot informative path planning under uncertainty, developing learning-based algorithms for coordinated exploration and search.

I received my M.S. in Mathematics from [National Central University](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en/index.php), where I was advised by Prof. [Kuo-Shih Tseng](https://sites.google.com/site/kuoshihtseng/). I completed my B.S. in Computer and Communication Engineering at [Ming Chuan University](https://web2.mcu.edu.tw/en/), working with Prof. Chaur-Heh Hsieh on deep learning models for atrial fibrillation detection.

Prior to returning to academia, I gained industry experience at [EverComm](https://evercomm.io/) and [TAO Info](https://sites.google.com/taoinfo.com.tw/taoinfo/%E9%A6%96%E9%A0%81), applying AI to solar energy monitoring and pharmaceutical automation.
